1
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,454
Sir.

2
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,785
General.

3
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,796
Sir.

4
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,484
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,368
- N'y a toujours rien? - Pas de signe.

6
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,323
- Combien de temps a-t-il passé? - Près de deux heures.

7
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,076
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,662
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,294
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,670
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

11
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,804
- The danger to the cavalry...
-ls acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,565
They say no.

13
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,049
People should know
when they're conquered.

14
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,311
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,521
Would I?

16
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,961
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

17
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,757
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,989
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,830
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,705
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

21
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,286
- Nock!
- Nock!

22
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,436
<i>Fratres!</i>

23
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,362
- Maximus!
- Maximus!

24
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,910
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,456
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

26
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,502
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,251
If you find yourself alone,

28
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,334
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

29
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,715
do not be troubled.

30
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,175
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,016
Brothers,

32
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,230
what we do in life

33
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,934
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,739
Pull!

35
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,378
Cohorts ready, sir!

36
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,395
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,269
49mm!
49mm!

38
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,823
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,657
Loose!

40
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,779
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,575
Hold the line!

42
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,957
Loose!

43
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,508
Reload!

44
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
Hold the line!

45
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,975
- Draw!
- Loose!

46
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,309
Stay with me!

47
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,896
Stay with me!

48
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,764
<i>Roma victor!</i>

49
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,714
<i>Roma victor!</i>

50
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,051
Do you think he's really dying?

51
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,462
He's been dying for 1 O years.

52
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,975
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

53
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,848
<i>Maybe he just misses us.</i>

54
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,521
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

55
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,893
Peace, Com mod us.

56
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,270
After two weeks on the road,

57
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,023
your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.

58
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,868
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

59
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,418
He will name me.

60
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,921
The first thing I shall do when...

61
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,011
ls honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

62
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,936
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

63
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,431
Your Highness?

64
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,229
We seem to be almost there, sir.

65
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,620
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

66
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,370
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

67
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,668
The wounded are still coming in.

68
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,370
My horse.

69
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,126
My lord.

70
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,758
Kiss?

71
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,207
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

72
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,095
Let us hope, for the last time.

73
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,757
There's no one left to fight, sire.

74
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,514
There is always someone left to fight.

75
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,516
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

76
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,523
Let me go home.

77
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,322
Home.

78
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,676
They honor you, Caesar.

79
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,550
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

80
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,243
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

81
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,705
You have missed the war.

82
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,002
Father, congratulations.

83
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,873
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

84
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,628
Save the bulls.

85
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,176
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

86
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,929
- General.
- Highness.

87
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,517
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you <i>as</i> a brother.

88
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,390
It has been too long, my old friend.

89
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,937
Highness.

90
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,606
Here, Father. Take my arm.

91
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,403
I think it is time for me to leave.

92
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,880
So much for the glory of Rome.

93
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,717
Magnificent battle.

94
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,371
General. Still alive?

95
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,743
Still alive.

96
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,449
The gods must have a sense of humor.

97
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,206
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

98
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,164
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

99
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,341
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

100
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,303
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

101
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,009
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

102
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,185
- Here he is.
- Highness.

103
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,432
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

104
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,391
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear,

105
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,068
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll
say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

106
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,817
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

107
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,775
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

108
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,076
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

109
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,155
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

110
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,490
A soldier has the advantage

111
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,997
of being able to
look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

112
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:06,081
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

113
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,292
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

114
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,557
Maximus.

115
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm going to need good men like you.

116
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,816
How may I be of service, Highness?

117
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,943
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

118
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,367
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.

119
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:40,244
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

120
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,789
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

121
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,997
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

122
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,759
Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.

123
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,012
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

124
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,351
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

125
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,026
Lucilia's here. Did you know?

126
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,441
She's not forgotten you.

127
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,074
And now, you're the great man.

128
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,872
If only you had been born a man,

129
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,213
what a Caesar you would have made.

130
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,345
Father.

131
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,352
You would have been strong.

132
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,682
I wonder, would you have been just?

133
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,106
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

134
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,650
How was your journey?

135
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,485
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come'?

136
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,662
I need your help. With your brother.

137
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,785
Of course.

138
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,992
He loves you. He always has.

139
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,248
And

140
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,294
he will need you now, more than ever.

141
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,256
Enough of politics.

142
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,476
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter,

143
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,429
and I am a good father.

144
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,729
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

145
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,209
Good morning to you.

146
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,892
I need three more horses.

147
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,942
One! Two! Three!

148
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,947
Fouﬂ

149
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,276
One! Two!

150
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,422
You sent for me, Caesar?

151
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,052
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

152
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,853
Why are we here?

153
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,683
For the glory of the empire, sire.

154
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,188
Yes.

155
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,195
Yes, I remember.

156
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,527
Do you see that map, Maximus?

157
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,864
That is the world which I created.

158
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,366
For 25 years,

159
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,791
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

160
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,960
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

161
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,545
Four years of peace in 20.

162
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,346
And for what?

163
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,566
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

164
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,147
Caesar, your life...

165
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,821
Please. Please don't call me that.

166
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,361
Come. Please.

167
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,526
Come sit.

168
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,079
Let us talk together now,

169
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,075
very simply, as men.

170
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,584
Well, Maximus,

171
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,129
talk.

172
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,087
Five thousand of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

173
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,967
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

174
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,514
Two thousand will
never leave this place.

175
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,809
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

176
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,511
And what would you believe?

177
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:16,440
They fought for you and for Rome.

178
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,313
And what is Rome, Maximus?

179
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,900
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

180
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,985
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

181
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,990
Yet you have never been there.

182
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,538
You have not seen what it has become.

183
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,662
I am dying, Maximus.

184
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,581
<i>When</i> a <i>man sees his end,</i>

185
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,709
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

186
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:44,005
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

187
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,382
Will I be known <i>as</i> the philosopher?

188
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,964
The warrior?

189
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,677
The tyrant?

190
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:55,806
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

191
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,228
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

192
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,061
You could only whisper it.

193
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,239
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,

194
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,157
it was so fragile.

195
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,162
And I fear that it will not survive
the winter.

196
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,160
Maximus,

197
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,002
let us whisper now,

198
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,954
together, you and I.

199
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,164
You have a son.

200
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,542
Tell me about your home.

201
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,681
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

202
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,809
A very simple place.

203
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,146
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

204
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,729
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day,

205
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,398
jasmine in the evening.

206
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,660
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

207
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,788
Figs, apples, pears.

208
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,709
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

209
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,916
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

210
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,248
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

211
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,958
He wants to be one of them.

212
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,839
When was the last time
you were home?

213
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:11,047
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

214
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,973
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

215
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,396
Worth fighting for.

216
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,352
There is one more duty

217
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,646
that I ask of you before you go home.

218
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,693
What would you have me do, Caesar?

219
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:35,405
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

220
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,576
I will empower you to one end alone,

221
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,587
to give power back
to the people of Rome,

222
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,007
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

223
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,930
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

224
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,228
With all my heart, no.

225
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,516
Maximus,

226
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,024
that is why it must be you.

227
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,197
But surely a prefect, a senator,

228
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,991
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

229
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,036
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

230
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,669
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

231
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,249
You have known that
since you were young.

232
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,300
Commodus cannot rule.

233
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,753
He must not rule.

234
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,095
You are the son that I should have had.

235
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,639
Commodus will accept my decision.

236
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:49,688
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

237
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,159
I need some time, sire.

238
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,703
Yes.

239
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,328
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

240
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,580
Now embrace me as my son.

241
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,715
And bring an old man another blanket.

242
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,443
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

243
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,022
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

244
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,533
Many things. Not everything.

245
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,076
Maximus, stop.

246
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,539
Let me see your face.

247
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,795
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.

248
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,052
What did my father want with you?

249
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,098
To wish me well before I leave for home.

250
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,217
You're lying.

251
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,895
I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.

252
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,472
I never acquired your comfort with it.

253
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:07,602
True.

254
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,775
But then you never had to.

255
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,986
Life is more simple for a soldier.

256
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,983
Or do you think me heartless?

257
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,736
I think you have a talent for survival.

258
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,289
Maximus, stop.

259
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,378
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

260
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,960
No. I'm tired from battle.

261
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,384
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

262
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,933
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

263
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,475
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

264
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,816
I will always serve Rome.

265
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,529
Do you know,

266
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,111
I still remember you in my prayers.

267
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,077
Oh, yes. I pray.

268
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,964
I was sad to hear of your husband's
death. I mourned him.

269
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,676
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

270
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,760
Yes. Lucius.

271
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,347
He'll be nearly eight years old.

272
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,679
My son is also nearly eight.

273
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,646
I thank you for your prayers.

274
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,949
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

275
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,824
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

276
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,250
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

277
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,334
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

278
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,678
<i>Ancestors, I honor you,</i>

279
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,138
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

280
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,247
Cicero.

281
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:35,954
Sir.

282
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,966
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

283
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,263
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

284
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,558
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

285
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,435
We may not be able to go home,
after all.

286
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,367
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

287
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,955
Yes, Father.

288
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,129
You will not be emperor.

289
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,801
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

290
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,425
My powers will pass to Maximus,

291
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,382
to hold in trust,

292
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,186
until the Senate is ready to rule
once more.

293
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,187
Rome is to be a republic again.

294
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,736
- Maximus.
- Yes.

295
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,071
My decision disappoints you?

296
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,663
You wrote to me once,

297
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,959
listing the four chief virtues.

298
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,084
Wisdom,

299
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,634
justice,

300
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,178
fortitude,

301
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,385
and temperance.

302
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,681
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

303
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,105
But I have other virtues, Father.

304
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,650
Ambition.

305
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,855
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

306
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,283
Resourcefulness, courage.

307
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,660
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

308
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:20,536
Devotion to my family,

309
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,038
to you.

310
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,338
But none of my virtues were on your list.

311
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,931
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

312
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,383
Com mod us,

313
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,931
you go too far.

314
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,723
I searched the faces of the gods

315
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:45,853
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

316
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,730
One kind word,

317
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,070
one full hug,

318
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,907
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight,

319
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,575
would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.

320
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,837
What is it in me you hate so much?

321
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,130
Com mod us.

322
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,301
All I've ever wanted

323
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:13,839
was to live up to you, Caesar.

324
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,764
- Father.
-Commod us,

325
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,274
your faults as a son

326
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,611
is my failure <i>as</i> a father.

327
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,782
Come.

328
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,795
Father.

329
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,438
I would butcher the whole world,

330
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,808
if you would only have loved me!

331
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,566
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

332
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,864
Lament with me, brother.

333
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,908
Our great father is dead.

334
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,229
How did he die?

335
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,188
The surgeons say there was no pain.

336
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,394
His breath gave out as he slept.

337
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,405
Father.

338
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,748
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

339
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,705
Take my hand.

340
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,258
I only offer it once.

341
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,774
Quintus.

342
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,485
Hail, Caesar.

343
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,072
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

344
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,749
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

345
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,043
<i>Sword.
Sword .</i>

346
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,461
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

347
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,339
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

348
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,296
The emperor died of natural causes.

349
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,301
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

350
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,684
Please don't fight, Maximus.

351
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,730
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

352
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,983
Ride until dawn,

353
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,781
and then execute him.

354
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,279
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

355
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,449
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

356
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,203
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

357
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,309
Kneel.

358
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,231
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.</i>

359
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,409
<i>Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.</i>

360
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,406
At least give me a clean death.

361
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,914
A soldier's death.

362
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,396
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

363
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,460
Praetorian!

364
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,125
<i>When was the last time
you were home?</i>

365
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:46,208
<i>Two years, 264 days and this morning.</i>

366
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,635
<i>Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.</i>

367
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,088
<i>I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.</i>

368
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,640
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

369
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,138
<i>...with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.</i>

370
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,392
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

371
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,769
<i>For all else is dust and air.</i>

372
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,036
Papa!

373
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,618
Don't die.

374
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,589
<i>You'll meet them again.</i>

375
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,925
<i>Not yet.</i>

376
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,226
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

377
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,011
Don't die.

378
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,226
They'll feed you to the lions.

379
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,603
They are worth more than we are.

380
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,077
Better now?

381
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,072
Clean. You see?

382
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,655
Proximo! My old friend.

383
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,119
Every day is a great day
when you are here,

384
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:52,745
but today is your most fortunate day.

385
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:59,088
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

386
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,630
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

387
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,843
You sold me queer giraffes.

388
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,433
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

389
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,856
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

390
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,858
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

391
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,583
Do any of them fight'?
I've got a match coming up.

392
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:42,461
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

393
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,884
You need both, I think.

394
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,176
Get up.

395
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,807
What's your trade?

396
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,767
I was a hunter.

397
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,567
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

398
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,728
Sit down.

399
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:08,948
Mark of the legion.

400
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,862
- Deserter.
- Maybe so, but who cares?

401
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,446
He's a Spaniard.

402
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,498
I'll take six. For 1,000.

403
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:20,078
1,000?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

404
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,254
These slaves are rotten.

405
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,503
It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

406
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,718
I can negotiate.

407
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:33,012
I'll give you 2,000,
and 4,000 for the beasts.

408
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,218
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

409
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,285
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

410
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,286
I am Proximo.

411
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:01,540
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

412
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,838
which will be the last
of your miserable lives,

413
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:08,258
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

414
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,887
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

415
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,308
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

416
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:20,806
And <i>as</i> your mother was there
at your beginning,

417
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,399
so I shall be there at your end.

418
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,942
And when you die, and die you shall,

419
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,779
your transition shall be to the sound of...

420
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,956
Gladiators,

421
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,621
I salute you.

422
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,419
Red.

423
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,428
Yellow.

424
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,842
Yellow.

425
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,683
Good.

426
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,853
- Red.
- Red.

427
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,071
Spaniard.

428
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,778
That's enough for the moment!

429
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,730
His time will come.

430
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,821
Next.

431
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,507
Spaniard,

432
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,798
why don't you fight?

433
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,637
We all have to fight.

434
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,430
Well, I don't fight.

435
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,309
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words,

436
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,261
and speak seven languages.

437
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,391
Good.

438
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,350
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

439
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,994
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

440
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,284
Freedom?

441
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,207
What do I have to do?

442
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,915
You go in the arena and you kill me.

443
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,371
And him.

444
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,089
And the Numidian,

445
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,758
and the deserter.

446
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,798
And 100 more.

447
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:00,722
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

448
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,133
I can't do that.

449
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,393
No?

450
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,064
But I can.

451
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,794
Is that the sign of your gods?

452
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,093
Will that not anger them?

453
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,071
The gods favor you.

454
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,614
Red is the gods' color.

455
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,160
You will need their help today.

456
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,155
Proximo!

457
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,666
Still leading with the German?

458
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,840
The crowd love a barbarian.

459
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,213
Besides that, he's making me rich.

460
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,920
Has that Numidian fought before?

461
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,347
No, first time.

462
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,392
And that one, laborer, soldier?

463
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,052
He's a Spaniard.

464
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,230
He might as well be a eunuch
for what he brings to the ring.

465
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:18,402
500 sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

466
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:22,198
And 1,000, that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

467
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,819
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

468
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,156
It's unethical.

469
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,115
What if I make it 2,000?

470
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,470
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

471
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,056
some that you can't fight.

472
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,891
They all say that until they're out there.

473
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,857
Listen.

474
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,860
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

475
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,707
Thrust this into another man's flesh,

476
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:16,790
and they will applaud and love you
for that.

477
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,290
And you.

478
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,215
You may begin to love them

479
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,463
for that.

480
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:32,051
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

481
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,892
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

482
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,939
but we can decide
how we meet that end,

483
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,355
in order that we are remembered

484
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,525
8S THEFT.

485
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,654
Come on!

486
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,909
On the left, draw your shields!

487
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,326
On the right, draw your swords!

488
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,166
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

489
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,711
Pair them up, red with yellow.

490
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:09,971
Next!

491
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:16,936
Move!

492
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,339
Usurper!

493
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,702
- Go away!
- You'll never rule us, Commodus!

494
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:35,821
He enters Rome like a conquering
hero. But what has he conquered?

495
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,527
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

496
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,904
I think he could do very well.

497
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,202
For Rome, or for you?

498
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,587
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

499
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,092
- Lucius!
- Mother!

500
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,928
Hail, Caesar.

501
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,510
Senators.

502
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:13,062
Rome greets her new emperor.

503
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,691
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

504
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,613
Thank you, Falco.

505
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,784
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

506
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,861
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.

507
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,447
All Rome rejoices in your return,
Caesar.

508
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,034
But there are many matters
that require your attention.

509
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,374
To order, please. To order.

510
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,629
For your guidance, Caesar,

511
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,507
the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols

512
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:44,681
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city,

513
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:48,852
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,

514
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,974
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

515
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,854
So, if Caesar...

516
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,899
Don't you see, Gracchus?

517
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,611
That's the very problem, isn't it?

518
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,698
My father spent all his time at study,

519
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,824
at books of learning and philosophy.

520
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:15,329
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

521
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,507
And all the while,
the people were forgotten.

522
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,298
But the senate is the people, sire,

523
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:25,927
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

524
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:30,226
I doubt many of the people
eat so well <i>as</i> you do, Gracchus.

525
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,438
Or have such splendid mistresses,
Gaius.

526
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,607
I think I understand my own people.

527
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,186
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
<i>as</i> to teach us,

528
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,230
out of his own extensive experience.

529
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,656
I call it love.

530
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,365
I am their father.
The people are my children.

531
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:54,159
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

532
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:57,712
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

533
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,630
No, but if you interrupt me again,

534
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,474
I assure you that you shall.

535
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,893
Senator, my brother is very tired.

536
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:17,062
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

537
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,567
My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

538
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,947
Who are they to lecture me?

539
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,787
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

540
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,745
What uses? All they do is talk.

541
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,504
It should be just you and me and Rome.

542
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,928
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

543
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,093
Rome has changed.

544
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,221
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

545
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,598
Of course, but leave the people their...

546
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,054
Illusions?

547
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,102
Traditions.

548
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,773
My father's war against the barbarians.

549
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:07,028
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

550
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,983
The people always love victories.

551
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:12,742
Why? They didn't see the battles.

552
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,040
What do they care about Germania?

553
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,459
They care about the greatness of Rome.

554
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,458
"The greatness of Rome."

555
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,211
Well, what is that?

556
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:30,138
It's an idea. Greatness.

557
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,308
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

558
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,353
Do you not see, Lucilia?

559
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,696
I will give the people a vision
of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

560
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,739
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

561
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,466
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

562
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,599
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

563
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,067
Games.

564
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:15,406
One hundred and fifty days of games.

565
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,449
He's cleverer than I thought.

566
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:21,078
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

567
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,161
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

568
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,042
Fear and wonder.
A powerful combination.

569
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:31,585
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

570
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,763
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

571
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,595
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

572
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,429
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

573
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,350
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

574
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,435
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

575
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,485
He'll bring them death,

576
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,611
and they will love him for it.

577
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,393
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

578
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,891
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

579
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,019
We want them to keep coming back.

580
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:31,274
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

581
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,232
Spaniard.

582
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,577
So entertain!

583
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,810
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?

584
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,356
Is this not why you're here?

585
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,989
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

586
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,452
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

587
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,008
What do you want?

588
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,724
Girl?

589
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,934
Boy?

590
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,101
- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.

591
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,279
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

592
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,526
You could be magnificent.

593
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,109
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.

594
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,038
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

595
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:54,333
The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles

596
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:58,588
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

597
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,093
I find that amusing,

598
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:04,514
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

599
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:08,059
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

600
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:15,183
So finally, after five years
of scratching a living

601
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,485
in flea-infested villages,

602
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,609
we're finally going back
to where we belong.

603
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,907
The Colosseum.

604
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,950
You should see the Colosseum,
Spaniard.

605
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,328
Fifty thousand Romans,

606
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:36,129
watching every movement
of your sword,

607
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:40,041
willing you to make that killer blow.

608
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,838
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

609
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:49,468
<i>It rises. It rises up,</i>

610
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,303
like a storm.

611
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,769
As if you were the thunder god himself.

612
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,818
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

613
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,451
You won your freedom?

614
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,870
A long time ago, the Emperor

615
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,624
presented me with a rudius.

616
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,418
It's just a wooden sword.

617
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,373
The symbol of your freedom.

618
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,545
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

619
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,344
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

620
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:33,678
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

621
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,397
You asked me what I want.

622
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,693
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor,

623
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,358
<i>as</i> you did.

624
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,862
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

625
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,782
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

626
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,662
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

627
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,086
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

628
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,418
I will win the crowd.

629
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:11,098
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

630
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,095
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

631
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,604
and have bloody adventures.

632
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,478
And the great whore will suckle us

633
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,151
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

634
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,694
And then,

635
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,943
when enough men have died,

636
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,577
perhaps you will have your freedom.

637
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,334
Here. Use this.

638
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:05,232
It's somewhere out there, my country.

639
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:07,655
My home.

640
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,987
My wife is preparing food.

641
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,661
My daughters carry water from the river.

642
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:18,036
Will I ever see them again?

643
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,827
I think, no.

644
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:23,587
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die'?

645
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,039
I think so.

646
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:28,759
But then, I will die soon.

647
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,846
They will not die for many years.

648
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,304
I'll have to wait.

649
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,555
But you would? Wait?

650
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,554
Of course.

651
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,849
You see,

652
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:47,566
my wife and my son

653
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,444
are already waiting for me.

654
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:55,199
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

655
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,617
Not yet.

656
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,919
- Unless...
- Not yet.

657
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,212
Not yet.

658
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,643
There he is.

659
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,897
Out.

660
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,030
Move, go, out!

661
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,250
Good to see you again, old friend.

662
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:39,306
Bring me fortune.

663
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:46,765
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

664
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:50,442
I didn't know men
could build such things.

665
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:01,995
Win the crowd.

666
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,540
Get inside. Move.

667
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,912
Inside.

668
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:57,877
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

669
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,890
Come, brother. It's late.

670
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,312
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

671
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,444
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

672
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:19,073
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

673
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:28,866
Commodus, drink this tonic.

674
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,886
I think the time is almost right.

675
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:44,177
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

676
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,350
at the celebration to honor our father.

677
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:48,393
Do you think I should?

678
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,059
Are the people ready?

679
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,560
I think you need your rest now.

680
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:03,325
Will you stay with me?

681
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,823
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

682
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,793
Still.

683
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:16,918
Always.

684
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,503
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

685
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,511
Then kiss me.

686
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,855
Sleep, brother.

687
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,782
Having servants who are deaf and mute

688
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:35,618
at least ensures I live a little longer.

689
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,755
They're arresting scholars now.

690
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,676
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

691
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,216
And mathematicians.

692
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,549
And all to feed the arena.

693
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,639
The Senate did not approve martial law.

694
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,563
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

695
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,851
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

696
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,483
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

697
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:08,284
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

698
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:14,036
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

699
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,747
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,

700
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,670
planning the festival
to honor your father.

701
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:24,341
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

702
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,302
So just what is he planning?

703
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,296
And what pays for it?

704
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,600
These daily games are costing
a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

705
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:35,765
The future.

706
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,185
The future pays for it.

707
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:43,520
He's started selling the grain reserves.

708
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,445
This can't be true.

709
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,566
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

710
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:52,073
The people will be starving in two years.

711
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,113
I hope they're enjoying the games,

712
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:57,575
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

713
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,252
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

714
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,122
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

715
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:07,300
And who will tell them
before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

716
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,129
You, Gaius.

717
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:11,930
Will you make a speech
on the floor of the Senate,

718
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,757
denouncing my brother?

719
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,848
And then see your family
in the Colosseum?

720
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,180
Who'd dare?

721
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:31,404
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day,

722
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,077
because my son is heir to the throne.

723
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,160
He must die.

724
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:49,297
Quintus and the Praetorians would
simply seize control for themselves.

725
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:53,256
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

726
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,386
Lucilia, Gaius is right.

727
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:59,595
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

728
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:02,640
So we do nothing?

729
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:05,522
No, child. We keep our counsel.

730
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:07,861
We prepare.

731
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:13,488
As long <i>as</i> the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

732
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,698
We are air.

733
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,496
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

734
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:24,454
One day, he'll have more enemies
than friends.

735
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,840
And on that day, we will act.

736
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:30,292
Then we will strike.

737
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,961
But until then,

738
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,722
we are docile.

739
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,346
We are obedient.

740
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,928
And we are treacherous.

741
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:51,734
Come on!

742
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,620
All right, that's enough.

743
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,523
The Emperor wants battles,

744
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,771
and I don't want to sacrifice
my best fighters.

745
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,195
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

746
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,865
- You get the battle of Carthage.
- Massacre of Carthage.

747
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,240
Well, why don't you go down
to the prison,

748
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,321
round up all the beggars and thieves?

749
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:42,577
We've done that.

750
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:45,034
If you want to give away
the best gladiators

751
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:46,289
in the whole of the empire,

752
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,496
then I want double the rates.

753
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:52,378
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract canceled.

754
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:53,879
You don't like it?

755
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:57,930
Then you can crawl back down
that shit hole that you came from.

756
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:03,180
Cassius, please. You can free us.

757
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,127
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

758
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,335
Yes.

759
01:27:38,128 --> 01:27:40,347
They said you were a giant.

760
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,596
They said you could crush
a man's skull with one hand.

761
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,427
A man's? No.

762
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,105
A boy's.

763
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,648
- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

764
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,781
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

765
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,989
They were my horses.

766
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,996
They were taken from me.

767
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,579
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.

768
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,461
- They let you watch the games?
-My uncle says it makes me strong.

769
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,836
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

770
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,677
Master Lucius, it is time.

771
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,297
I have to go.

772
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,972
Your name is Lucius?

773
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,765
Lucius Verus, after my father.

774
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,134
Lower!

775
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:08,181
- Claudius!
- Yes?

776
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,683
- More shields!
- All right.

777
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:34,537
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him,

778
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,667
and then speak together.

779
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,959
Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.

780
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,922
Go, and die with honor.

781
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:42,070
Hail, mighty Caesar!

782
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:49,528
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

783
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,534
- We who are about to die salute you!
- We who are about to die salute you!

784
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,836
On this day

785
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,541
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

786
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:07,091
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

787
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,218
of mighty Carthage!

788
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:17,352
On the barren plain of Zama

789
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:21,068
there stood the invincible armies

790
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,062
of the barbarian Hannibal.

791
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:27,945
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

792
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,402
from all brute nations,

793
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:34,786
bent on merciless destruction,

794
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,034
conquest.

795
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:42,001
Your emperor is pleased to give you

796
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,129
the barbarian horde!

797
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:55,468
Anyone here been in the army?

798
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:58,476
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

799
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:01,104
You can help me.

800
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:04,941
Whatever comes out of these gates,

801
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:09,487
we've got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

802
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,284
Do you understand?

803
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:15,451
If we stay together, we survive.

804
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:18,659
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

805
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:22,337
of Scipio Africanus!

806
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,849
To the death!

807
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,230
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

808
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:46,648
Stay close.

809
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,527
Come together!

810
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:59,916
Stay close. Staggered columns!

811
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,177
You don't have a chance.

812
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:29,067
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

813
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:32,156
Hold!

814
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:37,196
Hold! As one!

815
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:41,458
Well done.

816
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:57,182
Hold. Down low!

817
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,188
Yes!

818
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:17,528
Hagen!

819
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:45,184
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

820
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,185
Quickly!

821
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:53,605
- Get out there.
- Hurry!

822
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:35,984
Maximus!

823
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,624
Single column! Single column!

824
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,337
We win!

825
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,217
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

826
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,974
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage'?

827
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:50,805
Yes, sire.

828
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:54,101
Forgive me, sire.

829
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,902
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

830
01:36:57,687 --> 01:36:58,813
Who is he?

831
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:01,900
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

832
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:06,325
I think I'll meet him.

833
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:07,747
Yes, sire.

834
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,872
Hail to the barbarians!

835
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:30,224
Forward! Arms at ready!

836
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,448
Drop your weapons.

837
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:52,417
Gladiator, the Emperor
has asked for you.

838
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,245
I am at the Emperor's service.

839
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:24,066
Rise. Rise.

840
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,661
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

841
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,246
I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.

842
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:41,253
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

843
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:42,925
Or was it Hercules?

844
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:48,181
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

845
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:51,843
You do have a name.

846
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:54,512
My name is Gladiator.

847
01:38:57,807 --> 01:39:00,981
How dare you show your back
to me? Slave!

848
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:05,698
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

849
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,955
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

850
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,297
commander of the armies of the north,

851
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:24,717
general of the Felix Legions,

852
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,092
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

853
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,678
father to a murdered son,

854
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,431
husband to a murdered wife,

855
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,515
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

856
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,898
Arms!

857
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:03,339
Live! Live! Live! Live!

858
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:06,634
- Live! Live! Live! Live!
- Live! Live! Live! Live!

859
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:53,347
Arms, at rest!

860
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:50,321
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

861
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,574
Father.

862
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:55,813
Why is he still alive?

863
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,566
I don't know.

864
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,659
He shouldn't be alive.

865
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:02,907
It vexes me.

866
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:06,453
I'm terribly vexed.

867
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:19,591
I did what I had to do.

868
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:24,387
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

869
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:26,140
You do see that.

870
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:27,682
Yes.

871
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:35,695
What did you feel when you saw him?

872
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:39,440
I felt nothing.

873
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,949
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

874
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:47,206
No more than lwounded him.

875
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:54,000
They lied to me in Germania.

876
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:57,717
They told me he was dead.

877
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:02,304
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

878
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:05,724
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

879
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:09,429
Then you must let the legions know

880
01:45:09,512 --> 01:45:12,607
their treachery will not go unpunished.

881
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:14,900
Poor sister.

882
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,778
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

883
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:20,731
What will you do?

884
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,045
This way.

885
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:13,876
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

886
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:16,454
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

887
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:19,582
I didn't realize he would send his best.

888
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:23,302
Maximus, he doesn't know.

889
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:27,382
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

890
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:30,013
- I knew nothing...
- Don't lie to me!

891
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:38,225
I wept for them.

892
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:42,155
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?

893
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,824
I have been living
in a prison of fear since that day.

894
01:46:46,317 --> 01:46:50,163
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

895
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:54,250
To live in terror
every moment of every day,

896
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:57,124
because your son is heir to the throne.

897
01:46:58,996 --> 01:47:00,464
I have wept.

898
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:04,634
My son was innocent.

899
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:07,509
So is mine.

900
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:12,601
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

901
01:47:14,053 --> 01:47:17,023
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

902
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:20,939
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

903
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:24,488
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.

904
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:26,361
The gods have spared me?

905
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:29,910
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

906
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,532
That is power.

907
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:33,155
The mob is Rome.

908
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:36,868
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

909
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,748
Listen to me.

910
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:42,415
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

911
01:47:42,498 --> 01:47:44,751
But while the people follow him,

912
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:47,882
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

913
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:51,135
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

914
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:54,970
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

915
01:47:55,052 --> 01:47:56,804
One man above all.

916
01:47:57,888 --> 01:48:00,983
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

917
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,231
Do you not understand?

918
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:07,698
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

919
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,447
What possible difference can I make?

920
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:12,987
This man wants what you want.

921
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,289
Then have him kill Commodus!

922
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,706
I knew a man once,

923
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:21,916
a noble man.

924
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,792
A man of principle who loved my father,

925
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,844
and my father loved him.

926
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:32,969
This man served Rome well.

927
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,020
That man is gone.

928
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:42,308
Your brother did his work well.

929
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:44,064
Let me help you.

930
01:48:49,982 --> 01:48:53,077
Yes, you can help me.

931
01:48:56,405 --> 01:49:00,126
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

932
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,540
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

933
01:49:34,985 --> 01:49:36,658
What's your name?

934
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:41,249
<i>Julian Crassus.</i>

935
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:47,999
Name?

936
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,793
Marcus, sire.

937
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,428
My father's name.

938
01:50:00,928 --> 01:50:03,101
They must have known
of Maximus' escape,

939
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:06,024
when they found
the bodies of the four men.

940
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:09,069
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

941
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:13,278
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

942
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:22,332
Load your arrows!

943
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,880
Prepare to fire!

944
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:55,696
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

945
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,243
and never told me.

946
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:00,738
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

947
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:05,083
But a general is always in control.

948
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:10,126
Always in command, isn't he?

949
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,133
Yes, Caesar.

950
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:29,774
Then give the command. Say it.

951
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:47,784
Fire.

952
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:24,371
Maximus.

953
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:28,242
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

954
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:31,336
- Yes.
- In Germania?

955
01:52:33,247 --> 01:52:34,999
In many countries.

956
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:37,926
General.

957
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:28,886
You have a great name.

958
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:33,436
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

959
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:43,742
Yes, at the far end.

960
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,740
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

961
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,204
Senator Gracchus.

962
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:53,206
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

963
01:53:53,285 --> 01:53:56,414
I don't pretend to be
a man of the people, Senator,

964
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:59,045
but I do try to be a man for the people.

965
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:20,522
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

966
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,652
People of Rome!

967
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:31,414
On the fourth day of Antioch,

968
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:36,412
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

969
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:41,292
And in his majestic charity,

970
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:46,263
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

971
01:54:46,838 --> 01:54:50,263
with an historical final match.

972
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:55,648
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,

973
01:54:57,057 --> 01:55:00,527
Caesar is pleased to bring you

974
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:04,402
the only undefeated champion

975
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:06,449
in Roman history,

976
01:55:06,525 --> 01:55:11,452
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

977
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,183
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

978
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:38,982
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

979
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:41,856
This is not it. This is not it!

980
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:44,779
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

981
01:55:45,605 --> 01:55:48,199
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

982
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,987
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

983
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:54,949
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo,

984
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:58,706
Caesar is proud to give you

985
01:55:58,785 --> 01:56:02,631
Aelius Maximus!

986
01:56:15,427 --> 01:56:17,805
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

987
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:21,813
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

988
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:27,405
No, much sooner than that.

989
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:31,114
It's been arranged.

990
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:52,598
We who are about to die salute you.

991
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:57,724
We're with you, Maximus!

992
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,101
Fight on, finish it!

993
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:12,006
Pull, pull!

994
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:45,914
Loose! Loose!

995
01:59:14,022 --> 01:59:16,116
- Gut him!
- Kill!

996
01:59:17,567 --> 01:59:21,162
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

997
01:59:41,591 --> 01:59:43,639
- Kill!
- Kill!

998
02:00:21,506 --> 02:00:23,725
Maximus the Merciful!

999
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:38,649
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1000
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:48,492
Forward, arms at ready!

1001
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:20,858
What am I going to do with you?

1002
02:01:22,025 --> 02:01:25,495
You simply won't die.

1003
02:01:30,241 --> 02:01:32,619
Are we so different, you and I?

1004
02:01:33,745 --> 02:01:36,669
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1005
02:01:38,041 --> 02:01:41,716
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

1006
02:01:42,253 --> 02:01:44,005
Then take it now.

1007
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:59,062
They tell me your son

1008
02:01:59,854 --> 02:02:03,779
squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.

1009
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,575
And your wife

1010
02:02:08,822 --> 02:02:10,745
moaned like a whore

1011
02:02:11,866 --> 02:02:16,417
when they ravaged her again and again

1012
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:19,169
and again.

1013
02:02:24,420 --> 02:02:28,175
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,

1014
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:34,139
Highness.

1015
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:04,545
General! General!

1016
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:07,467
General! General!

1017
02:03:09,507 --> 02:03:11,305
- General!
- Cicero!

1018
02:03:18,766 --> 02:03:20,268
- General!
- Where are you camped?

1019
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:21,648
Ostia.

1020
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:31,079
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!

1021
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:33,657
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

1022
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:35,621
- Move along!
- Find me!

1023
02:04:01,476 --> 02:04:03,444
Can they hear you?

1024
02:04:07,023 --> 02:04:10,527
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

1025
02:04:13,029 --> 02:04:15,373
- Yes.
- What do you say to them?

1026
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:20,711
To my DOV.

1027
02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:25,087
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1028
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:28,761
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1029
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:31,548
To my wife,

1030
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:36,178
that is not your business.

1031
02:04:43,851 --> 02:04:46,730
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

1032
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:51,656
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1033
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:57,241
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1034
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:00,334
He is defying you.

1035
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:03,789
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1036
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:07,466
The mob sees this,
and so do the Senate.

1037
02:05:08,251 --> 02:05:11,130
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1038
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:14,424
- Kill him.
- No.

1039
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,769
I will not make a martyr of him.

1040
02:05:25,893 --> 02:05:28,362
When I went to the Senate today,

1041
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:32,909
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1042
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:36,992
And did you note what happened?

1043
02:05:37,071 --> 02:05:40,291
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

1044
02:05:41,284 --> 02:05:43,628
Not a single word of protest.

1045
02:05:43,703 --> 02:05:47,333
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1046
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:48,587
Why?

1047
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:54,014
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1048
02:05:54,088 --> 02:05:58,138
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1049
02:05:58,593 --> 02:06:02,314
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1050
02:06:03,306 --> 02:06:05,650
Then its enemies will approach,

1051
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:08,820
and yet it will lie quite still.

1052
02:06:09,145 --> 02:06:12,945
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

1053
02:06:13,024 --> 02:06:16,324
and yet it remains still.

1054
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:20,702
SO.

1055
02:06:22,033 --> 02:06:23,831
We will lie still,

1056
02:06:24,535 --> 02:06:27,880
and let our enemies come to us
and nibble.

1057
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,293
Have every senator followed.

1058
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:50,687
Cicero, my old friend.

1059
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:52,647
I thought perhaps I'd seen you
for the last time.

1060
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:55,279
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

1061
02:06:55,358 --> 02:06:56,985
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1062
02:06:57,068 --> 02:06:58,411
All winter.

1063
02:06:58,736 --> 02:07:02,036
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

1064
02:07:02,740 --> 02:07:05,789
- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.

1065
02:07:07,411 --> 02:07:09,254
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1066
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:11,128
For you, tomorrow.

1067
02:07:12,583 --> 02:07:15,086
I need you to do something for me.

1068
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:21,137
Come, see, witness.

1069
02:07:21,217 --> 02:07:24,266
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1070
02:07:24,345 --> 02:07:27,975
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1071
02:07:28,057 --> 02:07:30,685
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone,

1072
02:07:30,768 --> 02:07:32,441
by doing this to him, they do...

1073
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,031
My goodness!

1074
02:07:36,816 --> 02:07:40,411
- He got him, he's defeated.
- Give way!

1075
02:07:46,492 --> 02:07:49,086
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

1076
02:07:49,162 --> 02:07:50,709
- Back.
- My lady.

1077
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:53,211
I served your father at Vindobona.

1078
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:54,383
Back!

1079
02:07:54,458 --> 02:07:57,678
And I sewed General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1080
02:07:59,172 --> 02:08:00,765
Stop. Stop.

1081
02:08:01,299 --> 02:08:02,471
Stop!

1082
02:08:03,384 --> 02:08:04,806
Stand back.

1083
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:09,144
The general sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1084
02:08:10,850 --> 02:08:14,150
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1085
02:08:23,905 --> 02:08:25,248
Leave us.

1086
02:08:30,953 --> 02:08:32,671
Senator Gracchus.

1087
02:08:46,469 --> 02:08:47,766
General.

1088
02:08:48,846 --> 02:08:51,599
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough

1089
02:08:51,682 --> 02:08:54,777
that you can trust me.

1090
02:08:59,065 --> 02:09:01,534
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

1091
02:09:03,027 --> 02:09:05,746
Yes. I can speak for them.

1092
02:09:06,364 --> 02:09:09,709
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1093
02:09:10,076 --> 02:09:11,544
To what end?

1094
02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:15,339
Get me outside the city walls.

1095
02:09:15,915 --> 02:09:19,795
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1096
02:09:19,877 --> 02:09:23,222
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1097
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:25,550
But the legions
all have new commanders,

1098
02:09:25,633 --> 02:09:27,055
loyal to Commodus.

1099
02:09:27,134 --> 02:09:30,308
Let my men see me alive, and
you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1100
02:09:30,388 --> 02:09:32,061
This is madness.

1101
02:09:32,723 --> 02:09:36,068
No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.

1102
02:09:36,143 --> 02:09:38,396
I will not trade one dictatorship
for another!

1103
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:42,029
The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1104
02:09:42,566 --> 02:09:45,661
And after your glorious coup,
what then?

1105
02:09:46,862 --> 02:09:50,492
You'll take your 5,000 warriors
and leave?

1106
02:09:50,574 --> 02:09:52,121
I will leave.

1107
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:54,666
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,

1108
02:09:54,745 --> 02:09:56,418
under the command of the Senate.

1109
02:09:56,539 --> 02:09:57,711
SO.

1110
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:02,261
Once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1111
02:10:03,629 --> 02:10:04,630
Tell me why.

1112
02:10:10,761 --> 02:10:13,935
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1113
02:10:16,976 --> 02:10:18,853
I will kill Commodus.

1114
02:10:20,771 --> 02:10:23,866
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1115
02:10:25,609 --> 02:10:27,907
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1116
02:10:29,739 --> 02:10:31,787
His daughter trusts you.

1117
02:10:35,786 --> 02:10:37,459
I will trust you.

1118
02:10:37,872 --> 02:10:39,920
But we have little time.

1119
02:10:40,458 --> 02:10:42,210
Give me two days,

1120
02:10:43,002 --> 02:10:45,255
and I will buy your freedom.

1121
02:10:45,880 --> 02:10:47,223
And you.

1122
02:10:48,758 --> 02:10:50,351
You stay alive.

1123
02:10:51,844 --> 02:10:53,517
Or I'll be dead.

1124
02:10:55,473 --> 02:10:57,066
Now we must go.

1125
02:11:24,126 --> 02:11:27,721
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1126
02:11:27,797 --> 02:11:29,390
He'll find you.

1127
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:15,019
It won't work.

1128
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:18,098
The Emperor knows too much.

1129
02:12:18,848 --> 02:12:19,849
And <i>as</i> for me,

1130
02:12:22,184 --> 02:12:24,232
it's becoming dangerous.

1131
02:12:25,521 --> 02:12:27,774
You'll be paid on my return.

1132
02:12:29,859 --> 02:12:31,657
I give you my word.

1133
02:12:31,902 --> 02:12:34,997
Your word? What if you don't return?

1134
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:39,210
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo'?

1135
02:12:39,285 --> 02:12:40,537
Trust?

1136
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:46,542
Who am I to trust?

1137
02:12:47,126 --> 02:12:50,300
- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?

1138
02:12:51,088 --> 02:12:52,806
He makes me rich.

1139
02:12:57,928 --> 02:13:00,772
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1140
02:13:02,516 --> 02:13:05,110
I know that you would die for honor.

1141
02:13:06,437 --> 02:13:08,405
You would die for Rome.

1142
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,569
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1143
02:13:12,651 --> 02:13:14,949
But I, on the other hand,

1144
02:13:17,656 --> 02:13:19,499
I'm an entertainer.

1145
02:13:22,995 --> 02:13:24,212
Guard!

1146
02:13:29,043 --> 02:13:31,637
He killed the man who set you free.

1147
02:13:40,804 --> 02:13:42,647
Praetorians, master.

1148
02:13:48,812 --> 02:13:49,984
Halt!

1149
02:14:55,129 --> 02:14:56,927
Where have you been?

1150
02:14:57,381 --> 02:14:58,974
I sent for you.

1151
02:15:00,551 --> 02:15:02,224
Please, brother.

1152
02:15:07,975 --> 02:15:09,852
What's troubling you?

1153
02:15:12,271 --> 02:15:14,649
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1154
02:15:16,442 --> 02:15:17,944
I don't know.

1155
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:22,073
I thought you'd seen him.

1156
02:15:22,906 --> 02:15:25,409
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1157
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:30,422
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1158
02:15:30,831 --> 02:15:32,879
And he will bleed, too.

1159
02:15:33,751 --> 02:15:35,128
Very soon.

1160
02:15:36,629 --> 02:15:38,302
But not tonight.

1161
02:15:53,312 --> 02:15:56,236
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1162
02:15:57,566 --> 02:15:59,239
"It's a dream,

1163
02:16:01,111 --> 02:16:03,034
"a frightful dream,

1164
02:16:05,574 --> 02:16:06,917
"life is."

1165
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,714
Do you think that's true?

1166
02:16:12,456 --> 02:16:13,958
I don't know.

1167
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:19,091
I think it is.

1168
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,593
And I have only you to share it with.

1169
02:17:02,172 --> 02:17:03,799
Open your mouth.

1170
02:17:41,086 --> 02:17:42,884
You know I love you.

1171
02:17:44,965 --> 02:17:46,558
And I love you.

1172
02:18:23,212 --> 02:18:24,759
Out. Get out!

1173
02:18:25,964 --> 02:18:27,216
Move!

1174
02:18:31,887 --> 02:18:33,935
Congratulations, General.

1175
02:18:34,014 --> 02:18:36,813
You've got very persuasive friends.

1176
02:18:42,815 --> 02:18:45,318
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1177
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:48,870
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1178
02:18:48,946 --> 02:18:52,576
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1179
02:18:53,242 --> 02:18:56,917
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1180
02:18:58,914 --> 02:19:01,212
- You have done all this?
- Yes.

1181
02:19:02,417 --> 02:19:04,135
You risk too much.

1182
02:19:05,087 --> 02:19:07,089
I have much to pay for.

1183
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:11,727
You have nothing to pay for.

1184
02:19:11,802 --> 02:19:14,897
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1185
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,444
I am tired of being strong.

1186
02:19:22,396 --> 02:19:26,617
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1187
02:19:27,109 --> 02:19:30,238
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1188
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:33,783
Because my father loved you.

1189
02:19:37,703 --> 02:19:40,126
And because I loved you.

1190
02:19:42,708 --> 02:19:44,381
A long time ago.

1191
02:19:49,131 --> 02:19:51,259
Was I very different then?

1192
02:19:57,806 --> 02:19:59,558
You laughed more.

1193
02:20:03,645 --> 02:20:06,068
I have felt alone all my life,

1194
02:20:07,357 --> 02:20:09,030
except with you.

1195
02:20:12,112 --> 02:20:13,489
I must go.

1196
02:20:14,156 --> 02:20:15,282
Yes.

1197
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:44,986
There.

1198
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:58,033
And I got you.

1199
02:21:01,078 --> 02:21:03,001
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1200
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:05,174
I'm not a legionnaire.

1201
02:21:05,499 --> 02:21:08,093
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1202
02:21:09,378 --> 02:21:10,846
A gladiator?

1203
02:21:11,546 --> 02:21:14,220
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1204
02:21:14,299 --> 02:21:17,724
Wouldn't you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1205
02:21:17,803 --> 02:21:20,397
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1206
02:21:23,225 --> 02:21:25,068
The savior of Rome?

1207
02:21:33,068 --> 02:21:34,786
And who said that?

1208
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:45,213
Where's Lucius?

1209
02:21:46,415 --> 02:21:48,838
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1210
02:21:51,753 --> 02:21:53,471
- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1211
02:21:53,547 --> 02:21:55,766
She took it from a basket,

1212
02:21:57,175 --> 02:22:00,930
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1213
02:22:02,556 --> 02:22:05,776
- It bit her in the breast?
- Yes.

1214
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:10,406
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies

1215
02:22:10,897 --> 02:22:14,868
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1216
02:22:14,943 --> 02:22:17,537
- I think it's silly.
- So do I.

1217
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:20,957
So do I.

1218
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:23,585
Sister, join us.

1219
02:22:24,202 --> 02:22:25,954
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1220
02:22:26,038 --> 02:22:28,040
- I've been reading, too.
- Yes.

1221
02:22:28,123 --> 02:22:32,469
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1222
02:22:34,004 --> 02:22:36,427
We've been reading about
the great Mark Antony,

1223
02:22:36,506 --> 02:22:37,849
and his adventures in Egypt.

1224
02:22:37,924 --> 02:22:40,473
And the queen killed herself
with a snake.

1225
02:22:40,552 --> 02:22:43,897
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1226
02:22:43,972 --> 02:22:45,815
If you're very good,

1227
02:22:45,891 --> 02:22:49,691
tomorrow night, I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1228
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:51,488
He was betrayed

1229
02:22:52,689 --> 02:22:54,817
by those closest to him.

1230
02:22:56,693 --> 02:22:58,445
By his own blood.

1231
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:02,249
They whispered in dark corners

1232
02:23:02,324 --> 02:23:04,793
and went out late at night,

1233
02:23:04,868 --> 02:23:08,213
and conspired, and conspired.

1234
02:23:10,832 --> 02:23:14,678
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1235
02:23:14,795 --> 02:23:17,344
He knew they were busy little bees.

1236
02:23:19,299 --> 02:23:22,348
And one night he sat down
with one of them,

1237
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:25,138
and he looked at her,

1238
02:23:25,889 --> 02:23:27,436
<i>and he said,</i>

1239
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:31,194
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1240
02:23:31,853 --> 02:23:33,571
"busy little bee.

1241
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:38,952
"Or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1242
02:23:40,112 --> 02:23:43,161
"You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood."

1243
02:23:46,868 --> 02:23:49,291
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1244
02:23:51,373 --> 02:23:53,592
The little bee
had wounded him more deeply

1245
02:23:53,667 --> 02:23:56,386
than anyone else could ever have done.

1246
02:23:58,505 --> 02:24:01,384
What do you think happened then,
Lucius?

1247
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:03,851
I don't know, Uncle.

1248
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:12,944
The little bee told him everything.

1249
02:25:10,827 --> 02:25:13,831
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1250
02:25:14,664 --> 02:25:15,961
Proximo!

1251
02:25:16,833 --> 02:25:19,962
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1252
02:25:20,795 --> 02:25:22,138
Proximo!

1253
02:25:24,341 --> 02:25:25,809
Open the gates!

1254
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:33,938
Open the gates, Proximo.

1255
02:25:34,392 --> 02:25:36,645
Do you want to die, old man?

1256
02:25:37,854 --> 02:25:38,980
Here.

1257
02:25:39,564 --> 02:25:41,737
Everything is prepared.

1258
02:25:41,816 --> 02:25:44,285
It seems you have won your freedom.

1259
02:25:44,361 --> 02:25:47,956
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1260
02:25:53,036 --> 02:25:56,882
- Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1261
02:25:57,415 --> 02:25:59,588
Open the gates!

1262
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,058
Pull!

1263
02:26:09,177 --> 02:26:12,056
Move! Form a column on the left!

1264
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:19,070
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1265
02:26:19,145 --> 02:26:21,614
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1266
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:23,943
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1267
02:26:24,025 --> 02:26:25,823
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

1268
02:26:25,902 --> 02:26:26,949
Go.

1269
02:26:27,821 --> 02:26:29,664
Strength and honor.

1270
02:26:32,284 --> 02:26:35,128
Aim. Arch your bows!

1271
02:27:42,228 --> 02:27:43,525
Shadows and dust.

1272
02:28:25,438 --> 02:28:26,690
Maximus!

1273
02:28:32,153 --> 02:28:33,575
I'm sorry.

1274
02:28:59,973 --> 02:29:01,350
It's done.

1275
02:29:08,314 --> 02:29:10,191
And what of my nephew?

1276
02:29:11,276 --> 02:29:13,278
And what of his mother?

1277
02:29:15,363 --> 02:29:17,912
Should they share her lover's fate?

1278
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:21,665
Or should I be merciful?

1279
02:29:24,372 --> 02:29:26,295
Commodus the Merciful.

1280
02:29:32,714 --> 02:29:35,058
Lucius will stay with me now.

1281
02:29:36,217 --> 02:29:38,015
And if his mother

1282
02:29:39,387 --> 02:29:41,515
so much as looks at me

1283
02:29:42,682 --> 02:29:45,185
in a manner that displeases me,

1284
02:29:47,145 --> 02:29:48,567
he will die.

1285
02:29:52,066 --> 02:29:55,320
If she decides to be noble,

1286
02:29:57,071 --> 02:29:59,165
and takes her own life,

1287
02:30:00,742 --> 02:30:02,210
he will die.

1288
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:07,548
And <i>as</i> for you,

1289
02:30:10,335 --> 02:30:12,087
you will love me,

1290
02:30:12,921 --> 02:30:14,719
<i>as</i> I have loved you.

1291
02:30:16,299 --> 02:30:19,974
You will provide me with an heir
of pure blood,

1292
02:30:20,929 --> 02:30:22,772
so that Commodus

1293
02:30:23,348 --> 02:30:26,318
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1294
02:30:30,939 --> 02:30:32,691
Am I not merciful?

1295
02:30:54,546 --> 02:30:57,174
Am I not merciful!

1296
02:31:09,394 --> 02:31:13,399
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1297
02:31:40,842 --> 02:31:43,595
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1298
02:31:46,347 --> 02:31:50,602
Nothing happens to anyone that
he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1299
02:32:23,551 --> 02:32:24,848
Maximus.

1300
02:32:25,887 --> 02:32:27,230
Maximus.

1301
02:32:28,222 --> 02:32:29,519
Maximus.

1302
02:32:31,225 --> 02:32:33,068
They call for you.

1303
02:32:35,021 --> 02:32:38,275
The general who became a slave.

1304
02:32:39,525 --> 02:32:41,903
The slave who became a gladiator.

1305
02:32:43,279 --> 02:32:46,078
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1306
02:32:48,076 --> 02:32:49,749
A striking story.

1307
02:32:50,912 --> 02:32:54,132
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1308
02:32:56,501 --> 02:32:58,754
Only a famous death will do.

1309
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:03,221
And what could be more glorious

1310
02:33:03,591 --> 02:33:07,346
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1311
02:33:09,681 --> 02:33:12,730
- You would fight me?
- Why not'?

1312
02:33:13,810 --> 02:33:15,858
Do you think I'm afraid?

1313
02:33:16,771 --> 02:33:19,820
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1314
02:33:19,899 --> 02:33:23,620
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1315
02:33:29,367 --> 02:33:32,746
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1316
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:36,124
"All a man can do is smile back."

1317
02:33:37,917 --> 02:33:39,339
I wonder,

1318
02:33:39,961 --> 02:33:42,760
did your friend smile at his own death?

1319
02:33:43,131 --> 02:33:44,633
You must know.

1320
02:33:47,552 --> 02:33:49,350
He was your father.

1321
02:33:53,224 --> 02:33:55,568
You loved my father, I know,

1322
02:33:57,061 --> 02:33:58,563
but so did I.

1323
02:34:00,189 --> 02:34:02,783
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1324
02:34:05,403 --> 02:34:06,996
Smile for me now, brother.

1325
02:34:13,035 --> 02:34:15,879
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.

1326
02:35:10,301 --> 02:35:12,269
Ring formation!

1327
02:37:04,040 --> 02:37:05,667
Quintus, sword.

1328
02:37:07,168 --> 02:37:08,966
Give me your sword.

1329
02:37:12,381 --> 02:37:14,383
Sword! Give me a sword!

1330
02:37:15,885 --> 02:37:19,389
Sheathe your swords.
Sheathe your swords!

1331
02:39:34,857 --> 02:39:36,200
Maximus.

1332
02:39:41,572 --> 02:39:42,869
Maximus.

1333
02:39:43,449 --> 02:39:44,792
Quintus.

1334
02:39:46,452 --> 02:39:47,920
Free my men.

1335
02:39:49,288 --> 02:39:52,007
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1336
02:39:53,292 --> 02:39:55,386
There was a dream that was Rome.

1337
02:39:56,045 --> 02:39:57,922
It shall be realized.

1338
02:39:58,464 --> 02:40:01,058
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1339
02:40:02,134 --> 02:40:04,136
Free the prisoners. Go!

1340
02:40:28,911 --> 02:40:30,254
Maximus.

1341
02:40:32,123 --> 02:40:33,716
Lucius is safe.

1342
02:40:50,015 --> 02:40:51,437
Go to them.

1343
02:41:41,233 --> 02:41:42,655
You're home.

1344
02:42:09,303 --> 02:42:11,852
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1345
02:42:15,726 --> 02:42:17,524
We believed it once.

1346
02:42:20,731 --> 02:42:22,859
Make us believe it again.

1347
02:42:26,362 --> 02:42:28,456
He was a soldier of Rome.

1348
02:42:32,284 --> 02:42:33,706
Honor him.

1349
02:42:34,161 --> 02:42:36,334
Who will help me carry him?

1350
02:43:21,083 --> 02:43:22,756
Now we are free.

1351
02:43:29,133 --> 02:43:31,010
I will see you again.

1352
02:43:33,887 --> 02:43:35,355
But not yet.

1353
02:43:36,348 --> 02:43:37,691
Not yet.
